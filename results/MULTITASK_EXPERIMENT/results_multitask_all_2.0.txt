Mohammed lives on the NUMth . I saw him go down and I ’ ve never seen him go up . He manages the corner store with his wife Sara . She already changed her name to Sarita , perhaps she has already heard it so many times from the ladies who buy at the store . She works less , he now opens until late . The one with the motorcycle , first floor , strong and wears leather jackets . Although I saw him go in with a thin man wearing glasses and an olive green sweater . The older lady who dances , I have never heard music from her apartment but she assures me that she dances . I feel like she wants to talk more , but I don ’ t want to tell her my story . At least not yet . I wonder what all of them think of me . Of the girl they saw push a bicycle up the stairs when she lost the remote control of the garage . The one who they see singing by herself , with a helmet , gloves and covered up to her ears with a scarf . The one that probably is not from here , she has a coastal accent . If they knew that her plants always die , that she insists on having flowers but doesn ’ t know how to take care of them . She reaches the terrace on the NUMth after hearing some of the elevator

operator in Java ) . Provide them with a factory or builder object instead , and here is why : The Factory pattern doesn ’ t block your future development . You can add more methods for new types of objects if you need . The Factory pattern hides your objects behind interfaces , so you can change the implementation in the future without breaking user ’ s code . If you decide to break an API of your interfaces , you can add an adapter class for the old interface , so your code will be backward compatible . Use fluent builders — they are cool ! I am a huge fan of fluent builders . They provide an easy way for constructing objects , and with the support of IntelliJ auto-completion , you can create magnificent contextual scopes for parameters . Look at how cool the experience is : URL this is not the only design pattern people are using . Some people might want to use plain objects with getters and setters , so you might consider adding fluent builder API as an additional feature , leaving them to decide which pattern to use . NUM . Test your code ! “ You must know , my fellow adventurer , that the constructors put their shoulder to the wheel , and focused on the quality of their work . No rushing . No improvising . Every single part provided by the Guilds had to be durable and fully tested . ” Anyone who has pushed code to the production without properly testing it , raise your hand . * raises hand * Yup , I did it . And it taught me not to do this anymore . Wonder why ? First of all , it ’

seems to be the only code sample online yet , #Haskell-like syntax w / funky named RP ops ( zipDynWith ) @mattpodwysocki @Fengol It's like monads . You lose the ability to explain it from a novice perspective once you had that first AHA ... @andrestaltz Except non-techies knowing the practice of SL might not identify the code source as ( in ) legitimate .. not used to github etc . Do agree though @andrestaltz If non-technical people all start side-loading it can form a potential security risk though , if they can't assess whether the code is safe @jensschauder Sad that politics gets in the way of science / sharing knowledge @thomvis @headinthebox Mind blowing , right ;) So URL is basically creating Eriks own version / vision of the target language @gousiosg Very glad to have you as my rubber duck ! URL @onyame @CoolSWEng Fireworks ! Small projectiles of source code send over VTNUM terminals causing waves of electrons and magnetic bursts onto tape . @paul_irish Sitting at the tip of my chair the whole time . So many new nice debugging features . Especially love breakpoint gestures and nodejs debugger Seems that people don't know rxjs ' WebsocketSubject , no more wiring that yourself URL @BenLesh Githubs tags are ideal for this ! Just use this : URL That is of course assuming all large libs are on Github & use tags … @_jayphelps @m_podlasin @moroshko @rkoutnik Also relevant : Reactive Inspector for REscala , w / amazing features I ’ d wish we had for #RxJS URL URL @_jayphelps @m_podlasin @moroshko @rkoutnik Any other demo ’ s yet ? @moroshko ( see timeline ) and I ( URL shared stuff . Goals : learning / debugging / <others?> @bsorrentinoJ @markvanstraten @BenLesh @andrestaltz Thanks @bsorrentinoJ ! male nl
