"operator in Java ) . Provide them with a factory or builder object instead , and here is why : The Factory pattern doesn ’ t block your future development . You can add more methods for new types of objects if you need . The Factory pattern hides your objects behind interfaces , so you can change the implementation in the future without breaking user ’ s code . If you decide to break an API of your interfaces , you can add an adapter class for the old interface , so your code will be backward compatible . Use fluent builders — they are cool ! I am a huge fan of fluent builders . They provide an easy way for constructing objects , and with the support of IntelliJ auto-completion , you can create magnificent contextual scopes for parameters . Look at how cool the experience is : URL this is not the only design pattern people are using . Some people might want to use plain objects with getters and setters , so you might consider adding fluent builder API as an additional feature , leaving them to decide which pattern to use . NUM .

There is no country in the world where we have achieved total gender equality . In many countries , women are treated as second-class citizens , unable to work , vote , marry , dress , or live freely . Iran is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman . To the rest of the world , the Iranian Regime pretends that they are committed to women ’ s rights but this could not be further from the truth . In reality , misogyny runs rampant , women are considered the property of their closest male relative and have no legal rights . Indeed , Iran ’ s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has even called gender equality a ‘ Zionist plot ’ which would corrupt women .

During the Dynamic Equity phase all contributions to the pie convert to A-Units . After a certain trigger event ( e . g . break-even , stable profitability , organizational maturity , recurring business … you name it ) the Dynamic Equity allocation period ends and all contributions are converted into C-Units . Partners receive their slice of the pie in terms of a fixed percentage , their slice of the overall pie ( calculated in relation to the total A-Unit inputs ) . After that , D-Units apply for unreimbursed cash contributions . Theoretically , you could accept D-Units instead of A-Units for your cash expenses , I guess . But I would prefer the favorable valuation of A-Units over D-Unit interest rates . Both come with a risk , but in the case of availability of A-Units ( during the Dynamic Equity phase ) there is more to be won . I hope that answers your question .

If this is not the case , the use of these tools could in fact lead to greater social inequality . In sum , the opportunities and risks in the examples presented here point to a number of general factors related to ADM processes that can critically affect participation . These factors involve different aspects of the overall socio-informatic process and can be found on different levels . Here are three examples : Shaping ADM processes on the micro and macro level : Choosing data and setting criteria at the startof a development process can themselves reflect normative principles which sometimes touch on fundamental social issues . Structure of suppliers and operators on the macro level : Having a range of ADM processes andoperators can increase participation ( e . g . through credit assessments of people who have not been partof the system in the past ) , can make it easier to avoid the ADM process and can expand possibilities forfalsification . Conversely , monopolistic structures increase the risk that individuals will “ fall out of the system ” and get left behind . Use of ADM forecasts on the micro , meso and macro level : The interplay of technology , society andindividuals has a major impact on how and when algorithms are used and the influence they thus have .

The main aim of building this scheme was to educate customers and help them understand the idea of UX . This pattern shows that User Experience is something much more complex than it seems to be . It can help designers find areas that should be improved while preparing the product . User Experience is the way customers interact with a product . It can either meet user needs or not . Why is User Experience so important ? For example , if a customer can ’ t figure out how to change the password or sign up they probably will not go back to your website . As people remember negative experiences more vividly than positive ones this adds to the importance of getting the User Experience right . User Experience could be a main factor in determining if a customer will use your product again or not . It may also have an impact on the conversion rate . It ’ s a performance indicator that informs you how many people ( of all those visiting your website ) completed a desired goal , like buying a product or signing up for a newsletter . By creating a friendly UX you can increase sales on your website . So what exactly does a UX designer do ? Let ’ s take a closer look at their responsibilities .

"It is often assumed that pedophilia is a condition that can be learned and unlearned , and that MAPs who refuse to “ get help ” are malevolent . Such views prevailed in the medical community prior to proper research , but generally trust in different forms of conversion therapy , such as orgasmic reconditioning , for paraphilias started decreasing alongside trust in conversion therapy for homosexuality . Immutability of pedophilia is one of the arguments doctors bring when calling pedophilia a sexual orientation . The most common arguments antis bring are the following : NUM . Conversion therapy for MAPs was proven to work ; NUM . Pedophilia is a learned condition ( like a fetish ); NUM . Therapy teaches to hate one ’ s attraction ; NUM . Someone not wanting therapy means they enjoy being a pedophile . But the modern day medical community disagrees with it all . NUM .

"section of our web app gets its own pageI normally use pages whenever an app / website has more than one major section , which is reflected by a different major ID . Each major ID gets its own page , so the number of artboards I have to deal with at the same time stays relatively small . Rule #NUM : Don ’ t repeat yourself — use symbolsThis is probably one of the most powerful features Sketch has to offer : A symbol is sort of a blueprint of a graphics object ( which can be anything from a vector shape to a bitmap to a text element , as well as groups of those ) that gets stored in a separate page called – you guessed it – “ Symbols ” . In order to use a symbol in your artboard , you create a copy that , under the hood , keeps a steady connection to the symbol it originates from . This copy is called an instance of a symbol . The beauty of symbols lies in the fact that once you edit the symbol itself , all its instances will inherit these changes and update themselves automatically . Override text elements in symbol instancesSymbol instances can be resized and text labels overridden individually , which makes them a highly flexible and powerful tool in Sketch . Even better , using a forward slash in a symbol name lets you created sub categories , which is an extremely useful tool once your project , and hence your symbol library , becomes really large .

Final ThoughtsLinting and formatting are two very important concepts to improve code quality . Especially if both are run automatically while you are coding . Early feedback is important — finding issues later in the software development pipeline ( e . g . , through SonarQube that also performs a static code analysis of your code after pushing it to a repo ) can be annoying and maybe harder to fix . Thus , the barrier to deal with the issue right away is much lower if you get immediately informed about issues while you work on your code .

Following our own rules , the viewer is forced to quickly verify the threatening rising sand in the real world , which stops the experience immediately . In this case we refused to have a static walk through the desert , instead a dynamically rendered and triggered flexible story . So we controlled everything by watching the viewer and accelerating his head movements and triggering the parts of the scene in the right moment . But How Does it Affect Storytelling ? Looking on the transportation of filmed / captured content for virtual reality the problem is that the director doesn ’ t have the control anymore . So the content has to be experienced even if the viewer misses parts of the story and even more . The story has to be understandable with a minimum of reached content . In reverse an extended and flexible story with a lot of small hints and multiple ways of the narration could create always a unique story or experience and ensure , that the viewer gets most out of it . Another big problem for VR is that it has to take place somewhere . You have to stand , sit or lay to concentrate on the visual impression which makes you unable to move and or interact properly with your surroundings . So basically the biggest advantage of the technology , of emerging yourself to anywhere else , can also reveal the most weakest point in terms of storytelling .

For all this , design may be in the position of becoming an integrate educational field and a direct passport to culture in the next few years . EXPECTATIONS WAITING TO HAPPEN … For many times designers talked about acquiring a substantial portfolio of projects , but they rarely talked about acquiring a portfolio of knowledge , and that my friends , was the major difficulty that for several years prevented design from having a decisive educational role .

Of course one has to also do good to feel good as they say , but one has to do them as a second nature . And it ’ s not the same for everybody and not everyone can follow the same road map to find peace but one has to custom make his own map and allow others to do the same for themselves , even if it ’ s as wierd as hanging upside down in an igloo somewhere in Iceland .

The Black BoxThe Black Box aims to test how a viewer has to be influenced before and during a VR experience to create the immersion as deep as possible and furthermore to see if the VR can help the brain hiding the real physical circumstances , in the same time . The Black Box from OutsideThe experiment starts with the participant walking towards the open box forced to expect a different situation than watching a movie in cinema or in a couch like surrounding . URL shown , the viewer has to go inside the box before wearing the oculus . Sitting in a tiny box , with no sensory stimuli it got pretty fast pretty creepy for them . The cool thing is , that people seem to hide directly into the VR , like addicted to gain any kind of impression . Because we gave the box in the scene such huge attention , it became some kind of a reference object to the real world to the viewer . It was the feeling of having a gate from one reality to another and entering the gate through getting into the box . People reported that they thought they had to find the box again to exit the VR , so they were kind of shocked seeing them destroyed",male,germany,train

Suddenly , a small flame lighted up and moments later , a fire was burning strongly . Next to it , I could now see a woman of some age . She was all dressed in black , including a scarf covering her head . For a few minutes , she stood there , waiting . Then a second woman , younger but wearing similar clothes , appeared coming from the trail . They had barely time to greet each other when a third and then a fourth joined them . The last two members of the group took a little longer , but once they arrived , the six formed a circle around the fire . Then they took off their clothes , and I saw them more clearly . The youngest was little more than twenty years old , while the oldest had long passed her eightieth birthday . Contrary to what some legends say , I saw no unusual marks on their bodies . Naked , they started dancing around the fire , singing something in a language I didnt recognize . The dance lasted about half an hour , their bodies writhing in a chaotic , but at the same time beautiful , almost mesmerizing , way .

And that is probably the easiest solution when you are upgrading . But what about the middlewares from StackPHP ? For example , there are some simple ones that just add some headers but some ( like HttpCache ) are a bit more complex . And the idea of StackPHP was to be able to share your middleware , not re-invent the wheel . So , how to use them in Laravel NUM ? Obviously , the two interfaces are conflicting . Both use the handle ( ) method but with different arguments . So we could create a Laravel middleware that wraps the Stack middleware and calls its handle ( ) method with the correct arguments . < ? phppublic function handle ( $ request , Closure $ next ) { return $ this -> middleware -> handle ( $ request ); } But any Stack middleware needs a HttpKernel as first constructor argument ( by convention ) , so what do we pass as kernel ? The Laravel Application class still implements the HttpKernelInterface , but that just calls the middleware stack so that will crash your application . So we also need to create a wrapper for the HttpKernelInterface . And that wrapper needs to be able to call the $ next",male,the-netherlands,train
"you like the characters , speed of the show etc . ? You can ’ t answer these questions without seeing real parts of the show . Watch a trailer on YouTube . By watching a trailer you can get a first impression of the characters and the cast , do you perceive them as sympathetic , interesting or boring ? Does the character fit to the actor ? There ’ s a good chance you will like the show , if the trailer appeals to you . Watch at least the first two episodes . The first episode is usually called „ Pilot “ and the episode which was produced to convince the station to pick up the show , so it might convince you too . The second episode starts to develop the plot and gives an impression how the show will proceed . It needs time to develop a plot and for you to understand it , so it ’ s important to watch at least the first two episodes .

But in the context of our never-ending economic crisis , they have started to shift from new constructions to the rehabilitation and maintenance of buildings .

Fortunately , in the above trivial case the compiler will warn us about an invalid pattern matching ( Warning : no clause will ever match ) , but if the result is further we might not be this lucky . OK , so what can we do with them ? When should we use them ? This answer might seem slightly controversial , but … almost never ! Or at least as seldom as possible . Why is that so ? The macro language is primitive and error prone . Given the choice of using it or the higher level and usually more expressive language the macros are embedded in , we should almost always pick the latter . Apart from this a bit philosophical answer , there are also some very pragmatic reasons : They aren ’ t first class objects — we can ’ t pass macros around as we can do with functions . Macros can ’ t be accessed from modules outside of which they are defined — unless we use header files , what is more cumbersome than just calling an exported function . In general , reusing them requires us to do more work . Not a lot more , I admit , but still more . Connected with the above : Erlang has pretty limited namespacing support ( one flat namespace of module names ) , but using it can save us some headaches with name clashes . Macros shared through header files do not make use of even this simple namespacing mechanism . Macros are expanded to plain code , therefore",male,poland,train
"the product faster but also better than ever before . I believe that expanding the knowledge on programming influences our thinking about design and , as a result , we notice problems we wouldn ’ t be aware of otherwise . What ’ s important — it does not influence only the way we see the problem but also our awareness of possible solutions . Together with our limited horizon the probability that our product will encounter many problems along the way is increasing and later we can see serious consequences which could influence how the target audience would receive our product . Good design is not limited to GUI , aesthetics or completion of business goals . We all call ourselves Product Designers or User Experience Designers but have those roles not lost some dimensions when they were popularized ? Limited knowledge on programming causes us to reluctantly approach solving problems connected to purely technical side of building a product . We , designers , think that those are problems for programmers . And that is one of our biggest mistakes . Different teams working together on building product can bring amazing results . And it does not apply only to designer-programmer cooperation ... However , that ’ s not the topic for now ...

"with frameworks to get to know the MVC pattern and basic concepts . SummaryWe learned what PHP frameworks are all about , we got to know the most popular on the market , we know the differences and what is best guided by the choice . The selection of the corresponding framework is important because it can affect the fate of the project , and sometimes even the fate of the entire company , but there are no bad solutions . Most of the projects can be implemented in any framework . And the more experience we have in one , we will have more ready solutions made , our confidence in the correct operation will be greater and more importantly , we will create projects faster . The choice of the framework itself is also very important , but it is more important to take the time to get to know it , look for good patterns and create more and more complex projects in it . Personally , I recommend Laravel , it is a framework that focuses on programming fun , solves many common problems , and most importantly is the fastest developing framework that has a very engaged community , willingly shares its knowledge and solves the problems of others . Finally , I would like to emphasize once again — do not waste months looking for the perfect framework for the beginning — choose the solution that you think is the best at first glance . Trust yourself and you will not regret it . Then get ready for a long journey to experience and become an expert in using the solution you choose . Good luck !

I ’ m going to try and give you some tips that might get you on the right track to creating more relevant content . Ask your customers : The best way to find out what matters to your target audience is to just ask them . We often make the mistake of guessing what they might be interested in , which widens the margin of error . You can ask your audience in person , via email , via social media channels , via surveys , etc . This results in a mutually beneficial situation – you realize how to reach your target audience , and they receive the information that they want .

There is a certain spread of predisposition , of course there is , but with proper training and proper approach , the brain can be very seriously reconstructed ( for example , I was once very impressed with a study of a growth of brain of jugglers . It increases noticeably in volume with prolonged training ) , but it happens on a physical level — in simple words , understanding is the ability of several areas of the brain to act together . So for them being able to act together , they need a connection — neurons need to physically germinate into each other with their axons , so that the current of thoughts can flow continuously . This relationship is established only in the case when you are trying to do this action , which you are training , and do it regularly — then the body will gradually understand that you need a stronger connection and begin to sprout neurons into each other .

"post . String concatenation is a basic building block in every modern programming language . Many different projects , especially in Web , produce a lot of strings . And it ’ s interesting , how this problem is solved in different languages . In our case , in Java and Scala ( because it ’ s much easier to compare , and these I use day-to-day ) . There are a lot of posts on Internet about this topic . But still , there are something interesting to say about it ( I hope you won ’ t be bored ) . Yes , this is about performance and microbenchmarking , I know . Basically , this post is about how to make robust string concatenation ( with macros ! ) and performance comparison . You may skip this big part right to Graphs and Conclusion . What is string concatenation ? In JVM String object is immutable . If you need to create a new String with a content of two other strings , you need to create a third one . In Java you may concatenate not only string but any objects — Java compiler will convert an object to its string representation automatically . Scala compiler also does it . What will compiler do , when we write such code in Java : int a = NUM ; String b = "" s "" ; String str = a + b ; This code will be converted to this code : int a = NUM ; String b = "" s "" ; String str = new StringBuilder ( ) . append ( a ) . append ( b ) . toString ( ); Nothing new , it ’ s well-known thing .

"was caused from the point that those micro-planning was not fruitful . Another transformation was a fruitful emerging point : I had started writing in English . Those English writings had some advantages and also disadvantages . For instance , my fluency in simple English writing was getting better and better , and also it let me have a continuous contact with English language . But writing in English had reduced my recorded details . Writing in the mother tongue language let one express his or her expressions and feelings in a crystal clear manner which can reflect whenever he or she read them , and it was the very omitted point from my writings . So , last year , I started again writing in Persian . These days , my weekly writings transformed into some more complex detailed reflection on what went on last week , and so make my note takings better . However , I have lost those continuous contact with English , and it will reduce my skills in English . Last week , I started translating a technical document into English , and suddenly I remembered those writings . I found out that my English writings got weakened and my speed is noticeably lower than those days . I was thinking about what I can do to improve it , without leaving Persian weekly reports . These days , I started again blogging in Persian , and it triggered my mind to start an English blog . Reading webmindset — which is for Reza Shabanali — decorates my mind , too .

In this post , I ’ m going to show you what a great sharing page is made of , how to construct your own page and give you a working example with implementation details . Ingredients of a great invite pageA great invite / sharing page for an app consists of the following elements : - Suiting invite options - A reward system with an incentive - LocalizationA simple share button just isn ’ t enough to motivate most of your users to share your app on social media or get them to invite their friends . You need to give them an incentive . Candy Crush has probably the most famous incentivized sharing page of them all : The user can either pay to continue playing or ask friends to help him out . The best way to give your users a motivation to invite their friends to use the app is using a so-called two-way referral system , which Candy Crush is also using : If the user successfully gets another user to download the app , both get a reward . Choosing a rewardAny in-app purchase in your app is suiting , you could even enable an exclusive feature only for referring users . Just think about what suits your app best and keep in mind that you shouldn ’ t give away all your IAPs since you probably still want to monetize your users in some way .

"and children tell the truth . Can ’ t say if that ’ s always true or not , but sayings usually only survive if they at least resonate with a large group of people during a long period of time . To clarify my stance on the peace promoting aspects of “ mindless blather ” : youth all around the world seem to have a universal language and code of conduct , that transcend the usual divisions and barriers between cultures , classes and languages . If that would happen on another planet , it would probably be much easier to identify the youth as bringers of peace and unity . But because it ’ s happening on earth , and we are probably still attached to all our differences , we tend to judge the youth culture as inferior to ours . Which probably is true in many ways , like when it comes to literary excellence . But what good is literary excellence if you meet someone who doesn ’ t speak your language ? You will feel like a fool , lose most of your confidence , probably break off the communication or at best hire a translator . Chances of a real friendship or spontaneous interaction taking place , which will enrich and educate both you and the other person , are practically zero . Youth on the other hand don ’ t seem to worry too much about this mismatch of language and culture . They just find a way to break to this wall and make friends .

Originally we required third-party tools to take care of this , but since version NUM , Sketch has this awesome functionality built in . This is how it works : In a separate Sketch file , which will be your library , you define all kinds of symbols . Now if you start a new Sketch file ( or open an existing one ) , you can import the symbols from this library by linking it to the Sketch file . Once done , you can access all symbols from the library file just the same ways you access local symbols . Decide which changes from the shared library you want to take overAnd here ’ s the kicker : If you decide to edit a symbol in your library and save these changes , every time you open a linked file you will get a notification about changes to a shared library .

Moreover , it might not be POCD even if they experience distress , pedophilic disorder is still a thing . “ For example , an individual who openly acknowledges that their sexual interest in children is real and greater than their sexual interest in older , mature individuals , is someone who discloses this paraphilia .

"NYC streets ( W . Paul NUM ) . Tutli was an activist who was sexually radical . He stalks through the streets of NYC in guerilla theatre battle garb , pointing his gun menacingly at passers-by . The film is full of cuts between America and Eastern Europe . One other documentary scene shows Tim Buckley of screw has a plaster cast made of his erect penis by sculptress Nancy Godrey . Immediately after the image of the plaster penis the film cuts to Stalin ’ s face that announces , “ We have just completed the first stage of Communism . ” By these cuts the main contents of the film reveals the opposition between Western modernity and Eastern Marxist about human existence . Makavejev ’ s beliefs about free love embraced all kinds of human activities , not only sex . Mortimer indicates : “ the current sexual freedom of the permissive society , Makavejev believed was the freedom to discharge ourselves as machines . Sex has become a consumer society device amongst numerous other kinds of technological devices ” ( Mortimer NUM ) . Despite the fact that WR is not only an erotic movie to see and get entertained by , the film is placed in the category of sexploitation movies . WR is a sexual political movie and the erotic scenes easily offended audiences . The release of WR in the United States engaged discourses about pornography , the function of art cinema , Wilhelm Reich , and sexual politics . It also highlighted certain market trends within the intellectual community and engaged the growing cultural tensions that existed between different generations and social formations within that market .

"A “ concept ” is made up by our mind bundling a number of incidents together . Therefore , these concepts have realizations outside our brain . Like the concept of expectation . Every time we are caught of guard and become sad or angry , it is a realization of that concept . The reoccurrence of the same type of incidents has formed the concept of “ expectation ” in our mind . A single instance of expectation has two components : NUM ) The environment that contains it , including the mind and the context that it emerges in , and NUM ) The notion of time or future . What is the “ future ” component internally , with respect to our mind ? It is an illusion of our state in some time that has not come yet . We should not ignore the fact that we do not know what “ time ” is exactly , and we don ’ t know what “ exactly ” means in general . The feeling that we have about “ exactness ” is tied to mathematics . The logic is exact in math , given some initial axioms . In other words , if initial conditions are set , what unfolds after is exact . So , we need to agree on one initial assumption at least : “ Reality ” is what matters ( if you do not accept this statement , or you think other things matter too , do not stop reading . This is a sufficient assumption for the rest of this article ) . Then , another thing that we should agree on is the definition of reality . #pause : What is a definition ?

It challenges the assumption that we ’ re living in order to work , that we are corporate robots , mere mouthpieces of a capitalistic system forever chasing more stuff . Questions are not as innocent as they seem . Every question contains a whole set of assumptions , values and unconsciously held paradigms that say almost more about the person asking than the person asked . “ What do you do for a living ? ” in particular often contains the assumption that you are not valuable per se , because you exist , but rather that you are worth shit if you are not a successful member of the workforce with a prestigious and well-paying job .

"“ Young girls protest at the Womens March holding feminist signs and posters ” by Nicole Adams on UnsplashToday is NUMth March , the day after NUMth March .

We ( Women ) have this day to celebrate our genre and to remember to all the world that our rights are not the same as men ’ s rights yet . I took it more profoundly in my thoughts because for me , one of the fundamental things today is not only about showing others what we are capable of or what should be our rights . For me one of the major issues is that millions of girls of many generations were growing up with the idea of the impossibility . I grew up listening that ‘ I should be doing this or that instead ’ . I grew up with the idea that some things I was trying to do were not for me . I grew up with the idea that I shouldn ’ t be playing football because people could think that I could be a lesbian . I grew up with the idea that two really different worlds existed : Women ’ s world and Men ’ s world . Right now , nearly in my thirties , I figured out that perhaps we as women were being seen by the world in the same way as we have seen ourselves for years . That was our role like this for centuries . Almost every woman was educated following those rules and moralities that need to be dissipated from the future generations",female,portugal,train

Iran had said time after time that it was neutral in this bloody war , but if the Soviets fell that would mean the Nazis could repeat what they did in france also they already controlled NUM % of Soviet territory as well as most of its coal , iron ore , aluminum , and armaments industry . Any wise commander will tell you that the most dangerous enemy isnt the most advanced or the most armed one , its the one who is willing to die for his beliefs and the Nazis were willing to die for theirs . Now a willing enemy with advanced and brutal weapons is just the worst kind possible . If the soviets fell that would mean that the Nazis could access virtually unlimited resources to make tanks and guns and produce fuel for their airplanes and armored divisions . They would have been unstoppable . That was why the British and later the Americans decided to help the Soviets , and the best way to do that was to use the Trans-Iranian railway but Reza Shah still didnt wanted to be a part of this war and denied access to this vital railway . Normally with a little diplomacy you can achieve anything but this was no time to negotiate , every day counted . So the decision was made : occupation .

"not qualified medical professionals , and their “ help ” for the women does not go beyond pro-life propaganda . There are some exclusions : some centres collect donations for mothers and children , to provide them with clothes , or very rarely , money . Some Russian anti-abortion campaigners might help women with caring for their children : for example , on the « Сохраним жизнь вместе » ( “ Safe life together ” ) website one can find a list of shelters and help centres for pregnant women , most of which are affiliated with churches . But the pro-life organisations themselves do not provide any help for the women and call themselves human rights advocates , not charities . The most common argument used by the anti-abortion movement is the procedure ’ s harm to the woman ’ s health . From their point of view , any abortion is extremely harmful to the woman , and that even if she is underage , a birth is preferable , because it is a “ natural process ” . Take fr example a typical pro-lifer comment from the administrator of the “ Save life Together ” page : “ A pregnancy does not harm a girl . A pregnancy is the most natural process . It is people like you who are harming girls with abortions , spreading cancer ! ! ! ” Typically , pro-life propaganda is not based on any facts ; you will not find a single link to a scientific study on a pro-life website . Moreover , pro-life activists often use blatant lies , like the correlation between cancer and abortions ( which was never confirmed by the National Cancer Institute ); or simply distort the official statistics on abortions ( as they",female,russia,train

"people ’ s minds and imaginations , and the main focus seemed to be on what these protests were and what they would eventually evolve into , and this young woman , who took off her hijab in a busy Tehran street , became a second thought for most . The only foreshadow that this Girl of Revolution Street cast in the waves of protests to come was the question around the identity of this woman who so bravely exerted her human right to freely express herself with her simple , but powerful , gesture . It was only in the aftermath of the protests that people began asking who the girl in the video was . It was not expected that after a month of protests that her image would become a symbolic figure for people within Iran . But it was as if , through that one simple defying act , that she had inadvertently stood up for the basic rights of all of the women of our country . And while the Iranian diaspora in the United States , along with major policy makers , were busy on Twitter discussing how brave they believed this unknown woman to be , for me she represented something else . Not only did she stand up for her basic rights , and ours , but in standing there in silence ( without uttering a single word of “ death to ” this or “ down with ” that ) she simply waved her white scarf , and it was as if she was asking for peace as she delivered her poignant message about the Iranian women , like us , that are under the submission of Islamic ideology .

It is more than an “ device ” The online publishing expert Jonathan Steuer underlined years ago ( in NUM ) that VR is more than a “ device driven medium ” : such an approach would , he thought , do not do justice to what the experience of VR can do with a person .

The basis of each VR experience , is that the user feels he is in a different reality . “ Watching VR for the first time with a viewer on your nose is an intense experience . ” — Andy Chu “ What you should not forget , ” Chu says , laughing , “ is that watching VR for the first time with a viewer on your nose is an intense experience .

I can ’ t call these attempts anyhow other than pure demagogy . The purpose of the term “ anti contact ” is protection of children . That ’ s why it condemns behavior that can traumatize a child and permits casual social interaction . And this applies not only to maps . Everyone should be anti contact in regards of children .

"… inaccurate . How could this be fixed ? The first problem ( polarization ) could be fixed if IMDB could somehow get more people voting after they see a movie ; not only the people that either hated it or loved it , but everybody else . This would result in much more objective ratings . I know , this is easier said than done ; but they could try to put in place some gamification techniques , to either reward or make much more cool to have a complete track record of the ratings of the movies that you ’ ve watched . Something that makes you want to cast your vote every time you watch some movie . Right now the only reason to give a rating on IMDB is to either trash or praise a movie . The second problem could be addressed by “ forcing ” users to provide more info about themselves . This could result in much more personalized ratings depending on the person . A general rating is just … too general . They could do something similar to what TripAdvisor does with hotels , where you can single out the ratings from only people with your same profile ( singles , families , couples … ) .

He wanted the Shah to be a ceremonial monarch rather than a ruling monarch , thus giving the elected government power over the un-elected Shah . While the constitution of Iran gave the Shah the power to rule directly , Mossadegh used the united National Front bloc and the widespread popular support for the oil nationalization vote ( which the Shah started to support later ) in order to block the Shah ’ s ability to act . As a result , the oil nationalization issue became increasingly intertwined with the Mossadegh ’ s pro-democracy movement . The dejected Shah was angered by Mossadegh ’ s “ insolence ” . I will not be reduced to a figurehead who only exists as a ceremonial king . Damn that mossadegh and his blasted ideologies . - according to Abbas Milani the Shah shouted these words as he paced through the palaceBut Mossadegh and the oil nationalizations popularity prevented the Shah from acting against his prime minister ( which was allowed under Iran ’ s constitution , something that Mossadegh felt a king had no right to do ) .

NUM docs : Blade is the simple , yet powerful templating engine provided with Laravel . Unlike other popular PHP templating engines , Blade does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views . All Blade views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified , meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application .

Friends can ‘ suggest ’ or ‘ invite ’ you to join the group , contingent on admin approval . Secret Groups can not be found in searches . The only way to join a secret group is by direct invite .

"’ selectors like pseudo elements , : hover / active / focus / nth-child … Hey Ewan , I hereby invite comment and perspective from the Sociocracy camp . Feel free to chime in directly or point your Sociocratic friends to this article . Maybe I can learn a thing or two . :) The simple answer from my perspective is this : because it ’ s not . What is your answer ? Hi Niels , you seem to be saying that all these people in the community that see something good and positive in Holacracy are essentially falling for a “ fad ” , spend a lot of money and get no value out of it . Essentially , they are plain stupid according to your analysis . Otherwise they would stay away from such snake-oil practices . Right ? My view of the situation is that Holacracy actually did bring some worthwhile innovations to the table that some not so stupid people ( Tony Hsieh , David Allen , Ruben Timmermann , Ev Williams ) found convincing enough to give it a shot . All of them just stupid and deluded ? Hmmm . Unlikely , Niels , very unlikely . As I mentioned before : I don ’ t think that any and all criticism of Holacracy is illegitimate . For starters , one is certainly well advised to distinguish Holacracy as a practice from the business decisions made by HolacracyOne . Both are imperfect to a varying degree — as any management practice or any particular business . What I particularly object to in your argumentation is the lack thereof . You refer to third party articles as if those sources have decreed once and for all that Holacracy is dead in the water .",male,germany,train

Conservatives have been very successful at persuading working people that they are vulnerable not because of their own failures , but because of the selfishness of some “ Other ” : blacks , feminists , immigrants , Muslims , Jews , liberals , progressives — the list keeps growing . Instead of challenging this ideology of shame , the left has buttressed it by blaming white people as a whole for slavery , genocide of the Native Americans and a host of other sins , as though whiteness itself was something about which people ought to be ashamed . The rage many white working-class people feel in response is rooted in the sense that once again , as has happened to them throughout their lives , they are being misunderstood . Lerner admonishes liberals to stop ignoring people ’ s pain and fears . Trump may be racist , sexist and xenophobic ; his support does not reveal an inherent malice in the majority of the American people . If the left could abandon all this shaming , it could rebuild its political base by helping Americans see that much of people ’ s suffering is rooted in the hidden injuries of class and in the spiritual crisis that the global competitive marketplace generates .

I ’ ve been thinking about moral and ethics in the software development industry , more precisely , are software developers a force for good ? We are living in interesting times , times where algorithms are getting faster and more accurate at each day that passes . Times where processing power and data storing capability are virtually infinite . We are also living in times where access to technology is cheaper than ever and growing every day . With this in mind , it is important to ask the following question : what kind of software are we creating ? What kind of products are we providing to our peers ? Do we think about the dangers of our work ? Little disclaimer : I know that not all software is dangerous , in fact , most of it is not . A lot of the advances in science were only possible due to our work . A lot of good things happen everyday because of our work !

This means that for a lot of features , you don ’ t have to register any bindings in jQuery itself . InstallationYou can install it with npm , bower , mix it up with Elixir / Laravel Mix : npm install - - save jquery-ujsrequire ( jquery-ujs ); Or just copy the src / rails . js file to your project and include it like any other script . Some functions will work right away , but for some you need to account for CSRF protection . Handling CSRF ProtectionIn my last blog post I explained how CSRF protection works in Laravel and also showed how to use it with JavaScript . Luckily jquery-ujs doesmost of the work for us .

Risk : Efficiency gains achieved through ADM processes can hide the fact that the absolute level of available resources is too low or inadequate . NUM . PersonalizationOpportunity : ADM processes can democratize access to personalized products and services that for cost-related reasons were previously only available to a limited number of people . For example , before the Internet , numerous research assistants and librarians were required to provide the breadth and depth of information that results from a single search-engine query . Risk : When ADM processes are the main tools used for the mass market , only a privileged few have the opportunity to be evaluated by human decision makers , something that can be advantageous in non-standard situations when candidates are being preselected or credit scores awarded . NUM . Human perception of machine-based decisionsOpportunity : ADM processes can be very consistent in making statistical predictions . In some cases , such predictions are more reliable than those made by human experts . This means software can serve as a supplementary tool which frees up time for more important activities . Risk : People can view software-generated predictions as more reliable , objective and meaningful than other information . In some cases this can prevent people from questioning recommendations and predictions or can result in their reacting to them only in the recommended manner .

I strongly believe that each image is better if tells some sort of a tale — it doesn ’ t have to be a complicated one , but it ’ s storytelling that breathes life into static figures and makes the viewer feel drawn in . Details are a way of increasing the feeling of immersion — they can help you make your art feel more cohesive . The point of this article is to show you some tips and tricks related to details and storytelling that I ’ ve learned through the years I ’ ve been an artist — some of them come from my own experience , and some are a result of learning from others . Use light to make certain elements “ pop ” A very good way to focus the viewer ’ s eye on a particular element or part of your image is using lighting to direct their attention . I usually do this at the end of my work process , sometimes building the effect on several layers , with each set to a different layer style . How does it work ? Create an empty layer on the very top of your layer stack , and with a big , soft brush set to low flow and low opacity , gently paint in light and shadow with black and white . To get best results , experiment with colours and layer styles . Look at the images below and hover your mouse cursor over them to see the difference it made in one of my own works — “ Assault ” .

Bogged downTo be fair , this isn ’ t all Renzi ’ s fault . Italian prime ministers have a history of passing landmark reforms that look good on paper but are seldom implemented in full , if they are implemented at all . The reason is that implementation would require civil servants to spring into action . When they don ’ t , reforms linger .

"even though there ’ s a reference to Islam being the ‘ religion of the Federation ’ , I ’ ve got this feeling that artistic and cultural endeavours are not subject to religious barriers , the same way they are in certain Persian Gulf countries , including to some extent , Iran . Has Islam being the state religion in Malaysia been a major obstacle to the development of arts and music ? A : This is a tricky subject to respond to . I cannot speak for what religion control is like in Persian Gulf countries and therefore cannot make a suitable comparison . The practice of Islam in Malaysia is based on a dynamic interpretation of Sharia law because of our multi-racial society which is reflected in our Constitution . Everyone , Muslim and non-Muslim , has different opinions on religious freedom and Islamic practices and it requires a very deft and sensible hand to accommodate it in law , in social policies , and in cultural practices . Ultimately , what we are most proud of as Malaysians , is the diversity in our culture and how we manage it together . ‘ Together ’ is key in answering your question . Occasionally , this is subjected to religious interpretation and it becomes complicated to have inter-cultural forms of expression . Another way state religion controls the development of arts and music is in the exposure to other forms of creative work from around the world . This is a very contentious issue as it infringes on the choices of non-Muslims to have access to other forms of creative processes . For example , most recently , a huge discussion erupted about Selena Gomez ’ s impending performance in Malaysia as she was deemed too ‘",male,iran,train

Two persons showed strong insecurities about other people doing payments with their debit / credit card if their phone gets stolen or lost .

"with Ukraine and the election of Donald Trump , Italy ’ s constitutional referendum in December is being portrayed as the next battle in the war between populists and the powers that be . There is something to this . The Italian referendum campaign pits a center-left leader , Matteo Renzi , who is very much in line with the European consensus against an assortment of insurgents , from the populist Five Star Movement on the left to the anti-immigrant Northern League on the right and some of Renzi ’ s nemeses in the ruling Democratic Party in between for good measure . But the story of the plebiscite , and how it could end in Renzi ’ s downfall , is more about a young prime minister ’ s hubris than it is about transnational political trends . What is the referendum about ? Nominally , Italians will asked to approve several constitutional changes , the most important being a proposed makeover of the Senate . Now a body with equal lawmaking power to the lower chamber of parliament , it would be transformed into a relatively weak assembly of regional deputies . The goal is to make Italy more governable by reducing the need for broad and unwieldy coalition governments . Renzi ’ s center-left Democratic Party currently has a comfortable majority in the Chamber of Deputies . But the right won nearly as many Senate seats in the last election , raising the specter of divided government . The reform bill also contains measures to streamline regional administration . These issues have been overshadowed , however , by broader questions about Italy ’ s political future and specifically Renzi ’ s . As a result , the polls now show a tight race whereas “ yes ”",male,the-netherlands,train

On her last day in the camp , when her photographer , translator , and the protagonist of the story walked out of a tent she was in , she found herself alone with a man she had never met . The moment they were left alone , the stranger assaulted the journalist , grabbing her from behind . After fighting him off , she left the camp . She was too shaken to finish her story that day , and only wanted to leave the country . It was with the help of a senior colleague that she managed to calm down enough to go to the camp one more time to get the last quotes and pictures . Ms . Fischer was determined to report her story . This was when she met her first unexpected hurdle . The first organisation she contacted was Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) , and they could not help her in any way , because sexual violence was outside of their field . Today , RSF does not publish any general reports or surveys covering sexual violence against journalists , but does cover individual instances of it . The next organisation she contacted , Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) was very supportive , and kept the record of her assault . But what upset Ms . Fischer most was the reluctance of her faculty , and the organisation that sent her to write that story , to acknowledge her trauma , and to change their attitude towards the risk their journalists faced .

Access remote hosts via SSH - Atlassian Documentation :-) Pipelines are the newest feature of Bitbucket and they are Atlassians answer to other cloud hosted continuous integration platforms . A pipeline is a job that will be triggered on every repository push and which creates a new docker container with the code of the changed branch . Besides running your tests , you can also run SSH commands within the container and this allows you to use the pipelines for simple git deployments . To learn more about Bitbucket Pipelines , click here . In this example , I ’ m deploying a Laravel application to a public accessible test environment . The deployment is triggered every time code is pushed to the develop branch . First of all , we need to set up new SSH keys at Bitbucket to allow SSH commands . This process is carefully documented in the Bitbucket documentation . Second , we need a deployment script that runs the commands on the target server . On the one hand , the script makes it easier to apply custom deployment commands for the environment , on the other hand , we ’ re not able to SSH into our target machine and run commands",male,germany,train

Literature has suffered its own transformations during the NUMst Century , first , because of the ascent to power of large international corporate groups that govern its policies ; second , due to the competition represented by audio-visual media and the entertainment industry in general , both directed to a consumerism oriented society ; and , third , because of new technologies which are reconfiguring the act of reading and the way in which the audience reaches literature nowadays .

In short , human beings consume a cultural offer that easily integrates to their lifestyles . Books are still consumer objects , but not every type of book .

These elements include subjective distress ( e . g . , guilt or shame ) , psychosocial impairment , or the inclination to engage in sexual behaviors with children .

Since pedophilia cannot be changed , therapy for pedophilic disorder is aimed at teaching a person how to live a healthy and happy life as a pedophile , and , finally , accept their attraction .

"hood . Maybe you need to provide several libraries that share common functionality . No matter what , duplicating your code is always not welcome . You want it as reusable as possible . You want it modularised . You want it simple and easy to understand . This is why Uncle Bob ’ s SOLID design principles are so important to follow . I tend to distinguish the two most useful ones when doing architecture design : Single responsibility principleDependency inversion principleThe idea is to have small modules responsible for a strict thing that you can reuse across your stack . If a bug emerges — it will only need to be fixed in that one place . Important — those modules must not depend on each other . No direct compilation , nor cross-module class import . How to achieve that ? Colourful schemes are always cool , so let us see one : As you can see , the main layer is an interfaces-api module , which is being maintained as a separate library . It only contains the interfaces of all objects used across the stack . The concrete implementation lies in separate modules that implement the interfaces — like cloud-module , or core-module for example . In this way , every module needs only to declare a dependency on interfaces-api . This will enable them to access other parts of your stack via those interfaces , thus making them independent from the concrete implementation . “ Well , so how would one link those libraries together , without directly compiling one into another ? ” Well , the idea is to use the third layer for bundling all the modules together .

The scenarios remain extremely well balanced , so that the player can not be stopped too long , forcing us to be constantly moving .

Thank you Medium Staff for featuring Jessica . No matter how many stories of the like surface but every story of a person working selflessly for betterment of this world always draws admiration . NGOs such as Goonj are a perfect example for the same . On top of that when one finds the youngest possible people coming forward to serve the society , one is bound to marvel at their undertakings . It falls on the society then to give something back to such people . For one , we have awards or other acknowledgements . Other than that , it is also our moral obligation to provide for them , say through contributing via funds . It is a well-known fact that independent social workers do not have investors but rather have to gather funds from the public . More often than not , these are scarce and they have difficulty managing their work . On the other hand , recognition from various organisations helps them to both gain fame and attract more donators as well as to boost morale . There are platforms working solely for conferring titles and facilitating growth of such people in their own way but one such organisation is World Records India but as we all know , recognises only record holders .

I clearly remember my surprise when , during my first days at the new office , I discovered that Patryk spends almost NUM hours on design … Writing a code in Framer .

My main question is : what will be the next round for Catalonia and Madrid , as soon as Catalonia will be bold enough to declare it ’ s state independent from Spain , regardless of the Catalans who are not so keen to share this fate ? The peaceful dialogue Catalonia has been craving to have with Madrid for decades as equal partners ? After today the chances of this happening are lower than ever . It will never be peaceful anymore . And it has never been with mutual respect , as two equals , so chances of that happening now , with sincerity and trust , are gone with the wind . A phase of renewed solidarity where at least the Catalans will be happier than ever ? It certainly looks like that , if you look at their glowing faces , but what Catalans are forgetting is that not every Catalan is pro-independence , so the divide between the “ real ” Catalans with the “ right ” spirit and the “ fake ” Catalans with the “ wrong ” spirit , could become a serious cause of discrimination and conflict in Catalonia . It could lead to judging , disregarding or even banishing people who don ’ t speak Catalan . It could lead to seperate schools and businesses for Spanish Catalans and Catalan Catalans . At the very least it could cause arguments and disagreements that ripple through every family and community in Catalonia , as they have to take their stance on their degree of nationalism .

Often their initiatives don ’ t resemble abortions bans , but rather limitations . For example , in Italy a doctor has a right to refuse to perform an abortion on his own ethical grounds . In practice , this law has led to many Italian doctors refusing abortions for heir patients — despite the fact that , technically , abortions are legal in Italy . In the US , medical institutions that perform abortions have to face a growing number of rules that force them to shut down .

From the pro-life standpoint , an abortion cannot be justified . Even if the woman was raped , or is still underage , the baby has to be born — because “ it is not responsible for her parents ’ sins ” . This emphasis on the innocence of the child , as opposed to the sins of parents , is another characteristic trait of the anti-abortion movement . The pro-lifers put the full responsibility on women , and even use fear — for instance , they talk about the dangerous effects abortion can have on women ’ s health , but never mention that pregnancy can be just as dangerous . Natalia Moskvitina , the founder of the Russian “ Women Pro-Life ” movement , told us that “ teen pregnancies are not even up for discussion .

The rectangle inside our SVG has a width = "" NUM "" and height = "" NUM "" . viewBox : Initial situation : The viewBox is currently set to a width of NUM and a height of NUM ( viewBox = "" NUM NUM NUM NUM "" ) . This means that the viewBox has the exact same measurements as the SVG viewport itself . And because everything inside the SVG is relative to the viewBox , the scale of everything inside the SVG is NUM : NUM . So the rectangle is NUMxNUMpx .

"all sorts of content you want so that you can feature your products . Managing your content on an e-commerce platform could be a great challenge for someone without technical background , especially if they use a complicated CMS which is not as flexible as you could expect . Suddenly you must become a webmaster , designer , copywriter and a SEO specialist instead of focusing on the core of your business . Moreover , on many e-commerce platforms there is new blogging software ( much different from Wordpress , which you may be already familiar with ) that takes time to learn . No additional costs . You pay ( a lot of money ) your chosen web development company to build your website and that ’ s all . There are no additional costs later ( providing that everything is as you arranged with a company in the beginning ) . When it comes to the e-commerce platforms , the situation is quite different — mainly because of the subscription model . If you want to use some other , extended functionalities , in many cases you have to pay . For instance , when you need more than one language on the website , a platform like Shopify most likely won ’ t help you with it . You have to buy a special app or extend your account to Shopify Plus , what costs of course . Moreover , consider that installing too many apps may slow down your website . Summing up , e-commerce platforms are great for beginning entrepreneurs , because of their easy application . Of course it ’ s much more cheaper to open the online shop there .

It is better to “ go to summer to Europe ” than “ to fly to Mars ” . Imagine that you are climbing mountains , and on the slope there is only one peak that can be seen . Having risen on it you will see another , but not before . The transfer of goal-setting to yourself is an important point , and it should be treated regularly .

It is as much trans-geographical as it is trans-cultural , i . e . it has the unique power to galvanise us beyond strict definitions of “ identity ” . Q : Nowruz has been a bit politicized in the recent decades , and following the Islamic Revolution of NUM , religious authorities usually resisted the public manifestations of Nowruz and other festivals connected to it , such as Chaharshanbe Suri . What are the reasons ? Dr Arshin Adib-Moghaddam is a noted scholar of Iranian studies at SOAS . He writes , lectures and travels frequently and his books are must reads . A : The reasons are ideological . The revolution was a unique moment in human history in its explosive impact on Iran and the world . There are only a few comparable events in global affairs , including the French , Russian , Chinese and Cuban revolutions which all happened in the NUMth century , that is in the hubristic laboratories of “ modernity ” . A revolutionary explosion , by definition and whether one likes it or not , scatters the status quo . Nowrouz was a target of the revolutionaries because it was perceived to be a part of the political set up of the ancient regime of the Shah .

You can make it easier for people who don ’ t follow you on Instagram to find your content by using hashtags .

But first things first … How Instagram Hashtags WorkI remember when using a hashtag means that you must be talking aboutTwitter … nowadays hashtags became part of each social media channel . At this point , Instagram hashtag density tends to be much greater than Twitter ’ s because companies realize the success of their Instagram marketing depends on proper hashtagging . One of the ways people find content and contributors they enjoy on Instagram is to search with hashtags . Here ’ s how that works . When posting content on Instagram you can write a short message or caption and a few hashtags . The hashtags help organize and categorize images and video content , and that will help the process of content discovery and optimization . For example , a automobile manufacturer post this picture of a car , and then used the hashtags #Blue #Audi #RSNUM #Sportback #instaaudi #cars #instacars #cargram #automotive #instaauto when it ’ s uploaded to Instagram . By using these hashtags , the image is cataloged so other Instagram users who enjoy looking at images of cars ( one of the hashtags used in this case ) can find it — even though they don ’ t yet follow the automobile company ’ s Instagram feed .

In addition to this , Twitter could gamificate this whole hatching stage , helping new users gradually understand the platform and guiding them through the process until they understand the value of it .

Most of the people he did bring had little to no experience in government . Hundreds of executive-branch positions remain unfilled , including nearly all the assistant , deputy and undersecretaryships below the cabinet . That means that , by default , career bureaucrats , who may not agree with Trump ’ s policies , need to step up . But there is more going on . On the one hand , Trump is purging dissidents from the bureaucracy . He fired the acting attorney general , Sally Yates , last month for refusing to defend his executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim countries — an order that was later overturned by the courts . The reason the administration gave for firing Yates must have send chills down the spines of many government workers : It said she has “ betrayed ” the Justice Department .

It ’ s a kind of “ de facto standard ” on formating styles across almost all relevant IDEs and development editors . The main feature is that EditorConfig lets developers set file type specific whitespace rules automatically , across virtually all editors .

EditorConfig addresses a common annoyance that developers introduce source code to version control with different line endings and spaces / tabs settings . That ’ s where EditorConfig comes into play . You just have to drop a . editorconfig file into the root folder of your project and put it under version control .

"hours . Uber and Lyft , for now , offer unsustainable fares , subsidized by massive amounts of venture capital . Once the taxi cabs have vanished and VC dries up , ride-share companies can jack up fares without any limit — in contrast to licensed taxi cabs , where the government sets mandatory tariffs . And as could be seen in the legal fights , especially Uber does not give a f .. k about local laws and regulations anyway , so cities are looking at multiple-year-long lawsuits when they try to rein in the big ones . Public transport ( buses , trains ) is no full featured alternative to taxi cabs , in my opinion : in rural areas , buses often enough run twice a day and that ’ s it . The public transport networks usually entail a large amount of walking , which can be either physically impossible ( for elderly people ) or dangerous ( kids ) . A taxi cab , however , can be hailed from anywhere to anywhere , and regulators in Germany tend to manage taxi cab licenses in a way that ensures that even at nighttime in a run-down part of a city ( or in the midst of nowhere in the country ) there will be a cab at your location in a reasonable time frame .

"These are just some of the examples of poor API design , there are much more , but I think it ’ s ok for this section__metadataSadly , TypeScript usage in Angular is heavily based on Decorator usage . Decorators are great , but in runtime there ’ s a great part missing in the current web ( ESNUM quite is far ) — __metadata . It is disabled by default and only emitted if theres a compiler option specified . __metadata just stores the information about class / type / method / parameters etc . , marked with the decorator . This is needed to get this information in runtime . Think of reflection in Java-like languages . Without metadata , you can still use decorators — at compile time , but there ’ s not much profit in this case . Nevertheless , in our AngularJS app we ’ ve used this decorators , like @Component : export const Component = ( options : ng . IComponentOptions = { } ) = > controller = > angular . extend ( options , { controller } ); It just wraps our TypeScript classes in AngularJS component objects and makes them controllers . However , in Angular , despite being this language feature still experimental , it became framework core . This means that you ’ ll have to use reflect-metadata in absolutely any case . Very arguable decision . AbstractionsAmount of internal classes , abstractions and a lot of TypeScript-related tricks , do not help with community adoption and may even make a bad impression about TypeScript itself .

Once the first seasons was done I realised that I changed my point of view about many subjects . “ NUM Reasons Why ” covers instances of bullying , sexual harassment , slut-shaming , rumours , and rape . It made me aware that there is not enough attention given to teenage suicide . But overall , it made me aware of how today ’ s society is not a community . Everyone lives for themselves and does what is better for them without really thinking about what the other people around feel . I ’ m not saying you should put away your happiness to make others feel good , but we all need to do what is good for us without hurting others . I happens to everyone … we all sometimes a bad day . We don ’ t know what other people are going through and we all need to learn to use more kindness in our lives and listen more to others .

In another column , Garfinkle sketches out what such a more dangerous world might look like : We would be back to a spheres-of-influence world in which the greatest powers dominate their geographical and cultural peripheries and all the other great powers let them do so as long as their own spheres are not put at risk .

He founded his first company at a young age and subsequently started several different ventures . Recreationally , Michael Younessi enjoyed studying karate , which involves training both the body and the mind . Much of the mental training involved with karate comes in the form of etiquette . An essential part of karate etiquette is bowing , which demonstrates humility and respect for fellow students and teachers . The act of bowing has no connotations of subservience or religious meaning . In the context of sparring , bowing indicates emotional control in addition to respect . Failing to bow can be interpreted as a very disrespectful act . Students learn how to bow correctly early in their training since incorrect form can signal arrogance . The exact customs surrounding bowing can vary between different dojos . In general , students bow when entering and leaving the dojo , as well as when entering and leaving the training area and when they first see their instructor . Other situations may also call for a bow . For example , brief group ceremonies involving a seated bow often take place at the beginning and end of classes . Born in Tehran , Iran , Michael Younessi serves as the owner of Alea Investments , LLC , a private real estate company based in California .

If you use that hashtag with photos of car crash your are not doing the network — or the brand — any favors . Some of the top hashtags such as #food and #fashion may be relevant to your brand and are therefore are going to be used . However , don ’ t abuse and spam hashtags , because most of users ignore and blacklist brands that do it .

Instead , those brands are more comfortable either dominating hashtags or creating new ones that are related to their brands .

Just as their opponents , they refer to the right of every human to live , as stated in the Declaration of Human Rights . The core of the ethical conflict between pro-life and pro-choice sides is that the pro-life supporters count fetuses , and sometimes even fertilised eggs , as humans . Today , there is no one point of view on when a fetus can be counted as a human , and even different religions have different opinions on this ( e . g . in Judaism , only birth counts as the start of a human life ) . According to science , the embryo cannot feel pain until the NUMth week of gestation . But the opponents of abortions believe that any interruption of a pregnancy is murder .

Hey Austin , yes , the P-Units represent ongoing earnings paid out in cash for our members . In our case , there ’ s a whole Earnings Plan that comes with it to clarify the composition of the P-Units according to which contributions the enterprise values monetarily . ( I plan to cover our specific model in a later article . ) Once the Dynamic Equity phase is over , the A-Units get converted to your share of C-Units , your slice of the pie . At that point in time A-Units will no longer be issued to new members . The equity allocation process has ended ( usually , in a phase where there is no longer a big investment risk involved ) . New members who join after the end of dynamic equity get paid for their work in P-Units . They may also elect D-Units , deferred payment , thereby effectively granting the enterprise a loan . This option may come handy for the enterprise in times of cash shortage . As with any loan , the person who lends money receives interests at usual market rates ( NUM % or whatever it is ) in exchange for the risk of maybe not seeing your money ( again ) .

What does it mean to express ‘ Malaysianess ’ ? When we perform Beethoven or do covers of Ed Sheeran , are we expressing a Malaysian sound or culture ? How do we express a Malaysian identity , and what are we doing to promote and preserve our music and culture ? We have local artists and local music but it is generally divided by race and the obvious linguistic difference . Malaysia is a unique country to express identity as we are a multi-racial nation with very diverse expressions of collective identity . There is not one dimension as to how Malaysians can be identified and this sometimes complicates collective expression , even if homogeneity is not the goal of any creative work .

There can be multiple parts in your code ( say many functions sitting in their own lexical environment ) . Execution context basically provides the wrapper for the code to run , it manages which part of the code will run currently . JavaScript executes only the block which is being called at that moment .

GreenFrom cheerful yellow , on to more grounded green . In Feng Shui green represents growth and new beginnings . It has an healing power and , according to Ayurveda , green can be used as a blood purifier . It has a soothing effect on people , mentally as well as physically . The color expresses a feeling of safety and is associated with getting permission . Hence the expression ‘ green light ’ when you are allowed to proceed with a project . Although that might also have something to do with traffic lights . For Heineken the choice for green in their branding had probably little to do with the Feng Shui or Ayurvedic associations with green . Although in some circumstances you might see beer as a ‘ healing power ’ , it ’ s definitely not a ‘ blood purifier ’ . However , the natural character of green makes it a sensible choice for Heineken . A brand that stands for pure and natural flavors and is positioned as a quality brand . Green is perceived as a natural color , and is often used by sustainable , healthy and organic brands — preferably in combination with unbleached paperboard and a logo with leaves .

The snow fell heavily outside onto the Aurora Sky Station in Abisko , Sweden . Our guide Anna closed her eyes and motioned for us to do the same . The small exhibition room was airless and dark , apart from the glowing models of the solar system . “ When I first saw the lights , I thought I heard a noise . Like a hissing or crackling , it was otherworldly , very weird , but also very magical , ” she said . Everyone thinks they hear sounds when they see the Northern Lights . But the sounds people associate with the lights cannot possibly originate from them . The time needed for the sound waves to travel through the thin upper atmosphere for more than one hundred kilometers would be around fifteen minutes , so if there were any sounds , they would exist after our visual observations . “ But actually , during the Aurora Borealis , ” Anna said , “ electric and magnetic fields discharge static electricity , so we might hear the crackling of the",female,iran,train

". k . a . , the potential enemy of social diversity and inclusiveness . Regeneration and gentrification : any solutions ? Projects such as the DIY houses encourage interaction between higher-income and low-income households in the hope of strengthening social cohesion . But as wealthier residents move to low-income neighborhoods , rents and house values increase . As a result , low-income homeowners and tenants may no longer be able to afford to stay in their neighbourhood , and move further away from the city ’ s vibrant areas . Policy makers and project developers ought to keep in mind that regeneration of neighbourhoods should not be reflected by a single isolated action transposing a problem from one area to another . Concretely , a comprehensive approach could be supported by running regeneration projects within several different neighbourhoods simultaneously , to avoid the exclusionary displacement of low-income citizens and small businesses from one district to another . Additionally , the involvement of active grassroots citizen organisations is crucial to ensure the community ’ s goals and priorities are respected . These measures may sound cliché or easy to mention . But as logical as they seem , they are not always put in practice .

Follow mentions and conversations : You can alternatively narrow your scope to discover what ’ s hot within a particular topic or industry by using analytics and social media management tools to track the conversation around it . Observing what your target audience is sharing or saying regarding a particular topic can provide pertinent insights into their interests . For example , HootSuite and RadianNUM are popular tools used to track certain keywords . Align content with goals and brand : In order to earn and keep credibility , you must be conscious of your objectives as a brand when creating content . Your content should be consistent with your image , voice , and target audience to stay on track . Remember , the content created must be relevant and it should objectively help you achieve the main goal . Leverage content optimization : What your target audience is sharing and searching for online is of course indicative of their interests . You can use leverage content optimization tools and once you know the keywords and phrases being searched , apply them among your content to optimize your content . Choose the appropriate channel : It ’ s equally fundamental to know not just what your audience is saying – but wherethey ’ re saying it .

For some time now Sketch allows to nest symbols , which means different symbols can be grouped into a higher-level symbol . An example would be a symbol of a login menu that contains symbols of text fields and buttons . The ability to nest symbols and to control their resizing behaviour lays also the foundation for building sophisticated design systems in Sketch .

If you ’ re remotely familiar with HTML and CSS , the concept will be a no-brainer for you : You create a shape or a text element and assign style definitions to them that will transform their visual attributes , such as fill and stroke color or opacity , and in the case of text elements font family , font size , weight etc . Nested shared text stylesJust like symbols , text and layer styles can be nested using a forward slash in their name , which lets you organise your styles nicely in a hierarchical structure .

She hit the buttons out of sheer curiosity . Dee Dee is very reckless , but also very courageous . She doesn ’ t get insecure because the function of a button is unclear . She just presses it to find out what will happen and doesn ’ t care about the consequences .

"MODULE , ? FILE . The ? LINE ( and ? FILE , though arguably less so ) macro is indispensable when writing assertions or error messages . However , it ’ s not sufficient to write the assertion as a function — then the reported error line would always be in the function body . We have to write the assertion as a macro to get proper line numbers of the macro “ call ” sites . Moreover , even when we reuse existing assertions , but try to add some functionality , we also have to rely on defining a macro to maintain the correct line reporting , as in this macro for asserting equality of proplists ( assertEqual comes from EUnit ): - define ( proplists_eq ( Expected , Actual ) , ( fun ( __Expected , __Actual ) -> ? assertEqual ( lists : sort ( __Expected ) , lists : sort ( __Actual ) ) end ) ( Expected , Actual ) ) . Due to the fact that Erlang guard expressions can ’ t in general call functions ( apart from some BIFs ) , composite predicates for use in guards have to be written as macros . The record syntax doesn ’ t allow to access record fields stored in variable names . In case of composite record structures , it might be convenient to use a short helper macro for accesses instead of a multiple-level deep expression :-d efine ( get_inner_data ( Data , Key ) , Data #top_level_record . nested_field #inner_record . Key ) . Thanks go to Paweł Chrząszcz for pointing out this particular use case . Macros might be useful for code generation aka a limited form of templating .

"society than its message ; telling the time . By thinking of days as a collection of hours , instead of as sequence of events , people became more efficient and scientific . By starting to obey the clock ; society , and humans in general , also became more mechanical and controlled . Similarly , cartography , or map-making , greatly increased our ancestors ’ navigational skills , but weakened their native ability to comprehend a landscape by forming richly detailed mental maps of their surroundings as a result . A more recent example of how technology co-shaped the relation between humans and the world , is the introduction of the microwave oven , as explained by Peter-Paul Verbeek in What Things Do .

The difference between streaming and non-streaming doesn ’ t seem to be significant . ConnectorJ ’ s difference for streaming decreases with more rows : from two times degrade with small amount of rows , to ten percent for hundreds of rows . Here we see a substantial difference between streaming and non-streaming . In the case of MariaDB the difference is insignificant . We may see the difference between streaming and non-streaming decreasing from two times for small amount of rows to tens of percent for big amount of rows . ConnectorJ ’ s non-streaming is slightly better than everything else . Wire , microsecondsYou can play with charts here . ConclusionAs expected , streaming performance has a strong correlation with network bandwidth and latency . In the case of a local MySQL installation , the difference is insignificant , and times grows linearly with the row count for both drivers . For slow networks , it ’ s harder to distinguish between streaming and non-streaming , since network latency is unpredictable . In fast networks , the difference could indeed reach up to twice as long — but it decreases with the row count . So , if you have a local installation of a MySQL server or a powerful network between the application server and the MySQL server , then you may want to consider using streaming for your service from scratch . The difference in performance is not critical , plus you won ’ t need to worry about scaling so it won ’ t hurt your service reliability in the future .

PART NUMThe deterioration of all humbleness , is a road towards immorality . When you look at Trump ’ s behavior , you can see the deterioration of all humbleness : who am I ? I am the best , the greatest , the most … he constantly has to fill in from outside and tell himself who he is , because he does not feel it inside himself . He has to repeat and hear himself say it aloud again and again , many times a day . The lately brought up reason , by prof . Allan Frances NOT TO diagnose Trump as a patient that suffers from mental disorder — which strangely enough he does diagnose , by concluding he is not mentally ill — is , that because he “ does not suffer from the distress and impairment , we can not diagnose him as mental ill as that is required to diagnose mental disorder ” . Exactly this , hiding the distress , is — frightening enough — sometimes out of ‘ selfdefense ’ totally hidden . When the patient senses that he will benefit more by hiding his distress , he uses a masked-greatness-show . Of course he suffers from distress and impairment , his whole behavior is just this , trying to prevent the world to see him feeling the pain of not being able to love himself nor anyone else .

Surprisingly , GWT crypto work faster up to two times when using RSA with NUM and NUM keys . Unfortunately GWT crypto can ’ t generate keys and just freeze , and we use CryptoJS for key generation and we decided not to fix this bugs in random number generation . The main reason is that BouncyCastle originally was developed for slowest JavaME phones and contains best algorithms and execution optimizations . At iOS , we haven ’ t spotted any noticeable difference . Using plain java implementations , we can make any crypto that is a huge advantage for us . We also checked the size of libraries . For the web all messaging logic with custom proto , serialization and storage interfaces after all optimizations are only NUMkb . iOS Application extended by NUMMB , much less than Swift runtime . After this , we dramatically reduce our codebase size and usually when we find bug — it is a bug in the library , and we fix it at all platforms by one single fix .

"was firmly in the lead eight months ago , when parliament approved the constitutional changes . Two mistakesMuch of this is Renzi ’ s own fault . He could have avoided a referendum by working harder to secure a supermajority for his reforms in both chambers of parliament . That would have meant doing a deal with the very opposition parties that are now campaigning against him — which may well have been impossible . But Renzi instead welcomed the plebiscite as a chance to shore up his political support . I ’ ve argued before that complicated political issues don ’ t lend themselves to simple “ yes ” or “ no ” answers . The point of parliamentary democracy is to elect people who can weigh the pros and cons of a policy ; who can think through the long-term consequences and make sure one part of the electorate isn ’ t disproportionately affected over another . When referendums are called , too many voters will use it as an opportunity to express their general approval or discontent with the incumbent government , the “ establishment ” or the status quo . Renzi ’ s second mistake was to personalize the referendum by vowing to resign if Italians voted against him . That galvanized the opposition , which is keen to oust Renzi . SluggishUnderlying Italians ’ discontent is a sluggish recovery . Renzi , who came to power in NUM by toppling the former Democratic Party leader , Enrico Letta , has failed to live up to his grand promises of economic revitalization .

The Laravel NUM .

Both basically do the following : Take the Request object and do something with it ( optionally ) Either return a Response or let the next middleware handle it further ( until one returns a Response ) Optionally do something with the Response object , before returning it .

Over time , the meaning of urban renewal became less about the large scale demolition of existing buildings and new construction , and rather focused on rehabilitation .

In the modern day when people develop hundreds of software applications , websites or mobile apps the term UX ( User Experience ) is getting more and more significant , particularly in the IT industry . This term concerns a human-computer interaction and the usability of interactive products . The development of computers and electronic devices is a major reason why the importance of User Experience has grown . According to Don Norman — director of Design Lab at the University of California and former Vice President of Apple , User Experience : “ encompasses all aspects of the end-user ’ s interaction with the company , its services , and its products . ” He also said : “ I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow . I wanted to cover all aspects of the person ’ s experience with the system including industrial design graphics , the interface , the physical interaction and the manual . Since then the term has spread widely , so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning . ” Basically , we can say that UX is user feedback concerning the usability of a product . It matters what they feel while becoming familiar with your products or services . It is not merely a case of whether the interaction is pleasant or not . It concerns the ease of use , speed of working and the attractiveness or usefulness of a product . All these elements have an impact on customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction",female,poland,dev

"any Android framework class , you are probably doing something wrong . You want to test your code , not the third-party framework . Better isolate your codebase from any external code / classes / objects using interfaces and abstractions . In such way you will eventually have to mock your own interfaces , and not the external stuff . SummaryMake a module responsible for creating all the objects used across your system — using Dagger NUM might be very helpful ! This will let you control the lifetime of your objects , and will make your library less prone to memory leaks . Think twice about your API . It is the front page of your SDK / library . Hide as much as you can behind interfaces . Use factories to create objects , and consider using fluent builders for customisable parameters . Always remember to test your code . This additional work will save you lots of work in the future — you will be sure , that your new features won ’ t break the old functionality . TDD may skyrocket your code quality . “ Oh , I need to bring another barrel of beer , the current one is empty . Would you mind waiting for me for a while ?

Our goal is to demonstrate that the Free-Libre world has already worked on alternatives to GAFAM ’ s services ( Google , Apple , Facebook , Amazon , Microsoft ) . We want people to come and try services with us .

Those purposes make us not compatible with a model based on profit .

It needs two external objects to perform its task — UsefulDataRepository and UsefulDataTransformer . Both of them are interfaces defined in interfaces-api , and their implementation lies in separate modules : UsefulDataCloudRepository in cloud-module , UsefulDataTopSecretTransformer in core-module . All those modules are linked together in sdk-starter , which contains UsefulDataProviderFactory that creates both UsefulDataRepository and UsefulDataTransformer objects and passes them to the constructor of UsefulDataProvider . It may sound challenging , but this small overhead of work will save you lots of time in the future .

It ’ s not just about focusing on what you are doing , because to be honest watching a movie or a tv series is not really difficult .

One of the biggest obstacles in these projects is often a lack of what I call “ workplace hygiene ” , i . e . the maintenance of a tidy working file environment and the adherence to some basic conventions within your design team . As a result , as projects run longer and files grow bigger , people easily lose track of latest versions , send out the wrong files or struggle with time-consuming manual changes . This can be a recipe for disaster ( or at least a lot of headache ) unless you and your team agree on laying down a few simple rules that will make everyone ’ s life easier .

"business or a casual cocktail party , one can wear a semi-formal gown . This series will be covering JavaScript Engine ’ s behaviour with our code . It is essential for us to understand our code execution process . Whereas most of the time we are following a tutorial or a book that begins with Variables and Loops , there are certain aspects which end up being memorised than understood . My take in this series will be to help you understand how Javascript behaves while executing your code under the hood . There are three basic fundamental concepts that we need to understand in order to get the real idea about JS underlying behaviour . Syntax Parsers , Lexical Environment andExecution Context . Lets begin by understanding Syntax parsers : Every Programming language has set of grammatical rules which is required to follow while writing our code . Syntax parsers are programs that read our code and checks if the grammar required for JavaScript in our case is correct or not ? Based on that actions of throwing an error or allowing the code to run is actioned . Lexical Environment : This refers to where something in your code ( be it variable or functions etc . ) sits physically . To make it clear , in JS it matters where you put your functions and variables . Although this precedence is not something required for us to concentrate while understanding Lexical Environment , but we should just keep this is mind , for certain languages it matters where you put your code . Execution Context is very important . I want you to pay a very close attention to this . Read it multiple times if you have to but this is an important aspect of",male,new-delhi,dev

Sleeping position : The sleeping position of the mother is also important when it comes to the stable and healthy growth of the child . One must note that doctors also advise right sleeping positions as lying down in the wrong position may hamper the growth of the child . Room colour : When considering pregnancy , astrologers say that the colour of the room also affects the mother and the child and therefore , dark colours should be avoided , and soft and subtle colours should be included in the environment . Dark and dull colours may cause depression thus affecting the mood and health of the mother and child . Bright colours , on the other hand , tend to induce positivity and help to lighten the mood . Eating right : This is another point which even doctors prioritize . Astrologers also have the knowledge about what kind of food the mother should consume , in what quantity and at what time . More positivity : It is important for the to-be mother to stay in a positive state of mind at all times . This can be achieved by reading things which make the person happy .

If these three happen , you ’ re in crisis mode : - A social media crisis is a decisive change from the norm . - A social media crisis has information asymmetry . - A social media crisis has a potentially material impact on the company overall . And now the million-dollar question : What should you have in a crisis plan ? You need to make sure you have a process , which all team members are familiar with , for dealing with any situation . Here are some suggestions of what you might include in your social media crisis plan : Acknowledge / Detect : To effectively manage your social media , you have to be tuned into the chatter surrounding your brand . That means using a listening tool to monitor all mentions of your brand . Your first response should always be “ yes , we realize something has happened ” even if you don ’ t have real answers . This will get you some time to prepare the next move . Identify : What led into the problem ?",male,portugal,test

"— sky — blue is also there for the taking . PurpleThen last but not least , purple . With a mix of a strong warm hue ( red ) and a strong cool hue ( blue ) , purple has both warm and cool properties . Too much purple can make you feel moody , but the right amount can bring inspiration and relaxation . In a working environment , purple is perfect for stimulating creativity ( Feng Shui ) . In general purple calms the mind and nerves , it can even offer a sense of spirituality . Leonardo da Vinci even believed the power of meditation increased ten times when bathed in purple light . Historically purple is seen as a royal color , only worn by the wealthy and sophisticated royalty . This heritage is still noticeable in it ’ s association with luxury and quality . Also explaining why in the US the poker chip with the most value is purple . For greeting card icon Hallmark , the association with creativity and quality makes purple the perfect choice for their brand ’ s color .

"speculation that the uprising will die out or be crushed by the regime . However , a key barrier has been broken : Iranians are no longer contained by the wall of fear created by the Islamic Republic . Not only has Iran ’ s theocracy lost its legitimacy , but it has lost its ability to control the public through the instruments of violence . Unlike in past protests , countless Iranians have demonstrated that they will no longer participate in the political game of “ reformist vs . conservative ” ( better known as “ moderates vs . conservatives ” in the West ) . For them , no one from the establishment , including the so-called reformists , can make their lives better . For them , the entire system has to fall for a new Iran to be reborn … The current revolt may not lead to the immediate collapse of the regime , but we are witnessing the death throes of the Islamic Republic . Even if the uprising ends today , it is but one step in a long struggle to achieve a more representative , democratic and popular government .

There ’ s a saying in Catalonia : “ Fan més fressa dos que cridin que cent que callin ” , meaning that two persons who yell make more noise than ten who remain silent . It ’ s exactly this combination of no nonsense , wit and courage that makes the Catalans so hard to defeat or beat into submission . The central government of Spain , usually referred to as “ Madrid ” has succeeded in fanning the fire of nationalism in almost every Catalan household , by prohibiting their self instigated vote for independence on October NUMst . Probably not the most clever move imaginable , because in previous votes there has not been a majority vote for independence , nor was this expected a few weeks ago . Becoming independent of Spain would mean a huge challenge for Catalonia to renegotiate their economic positions with all the countries they do business with . Not a fun thing to do when you ’ re just battling your way out of a huge recession . So a lot of Catalan entrepreneurs , shopkeepers and businesses , mainly concentrated in the business metropole of Barcelona , have stayed out of the arena , and just hoped that all the fuss of becoming a fledgling nation would blow over one day .

Going through the whole production cycle leads to a deeper understanding . Moreover it also makes me rethink and question my consumer habits and my personal position towards food production and consumption . Active involvement in gardening triggers reflection about the origin of food and our own environmental impact . Having a garden requires thinking about responsibility . This was a week before harvesting the first seeds — so satisfying . Since I started working on this season ’ s garden , I ’ m constantly coming up with ideas on how to improve or supplement the existing on-site structures . It is crucial to have a compost in order to make waste nutrients fully accessible again and thus close the material cycle . I will be working on ways to increase the amount of organic waste we can recycle , to ensure compost health and to implement further composting methods with Oyster mushrooms and a worm compost .

"experience , something we are simply not able to in real life . A year later , nothing really changed , the VR demos were still the same demos , with more or less interesting features and when we watched the first heavily announced VR Movie , we were very disappointed . Our assumptions on what should be happening just went a lot further . The DisappointmentThe first disappointment we experienced while watching a ( VR ) movie through goggles was that the director wasn ’ t aware of the function of basic methods in film making and what they were used for . For example cutting from one persons face to another in a dialog will help a viewer watching a regular movie to follow the story . But in VR , people will intuitively move their heads and execute this step on their own . That means that normal methods of film making don ’ t work anymore and moreover most of them result in constant disorientation because for example the cut and the movement in total makes you look somewhere behind you . Disorientation is a huge problem because searching for the right thing to look at makes you miss most of the story . But what is left if you remove almost every method of film making developed over many decades ? The most important part from our point of view is not how it ’ s edited , it ’ s the characters and how the story can deeply address to our emotions . This seemed pretty certain to work with so we decided to focus on the technological part to find out how to implement or to combine these components as best as possible . So we decided to set up some experiments to",male,germany,test

"we can try to foster the beneficent effects and neutralise the adverse effects . In order to do so , we must first find an answer to the question : how are interactions with technology affecting people ’ s lives ? The relation between people and technologyThroughout history historians , philosophers and anthropologists have traced , and debated , technology ’ s role in shaping human activity and civilisations . Determinists argue that technologies not only aid , but also shape human activity . They argue that technology exerts its power on society as an autonomous force outside man ’ s control . On the other end of this debate are instrumentalists . They believe tools and technology to be neutral artefacts , entirely subservient to the conscious decisions made by people . Technology can also be understood as a mediator between humans and the world . This approach is neither determinist nor instrumentalist , but somewhere in between .

Harrods , LondonIf you are looking a little bit more of an affordable way of living , you should definitely hit up Camden ! This area is known for its vintage markets , stores , and little boutiques . This neighbourhood is known for its more artistic and hipster-ish kind of feel . With its diverse mix of people , stores , and restaurants it creates such an interesting feeling and vibe , very relaxed and an ‘ everything is okay just be yourself ’ kind of mindset that I personally really love ! Vintage department store Blitz is the first one of its kind in London , and the biggest one in the whole world ! It basically is like any other department store only than totally filled with vintage clothes , shoes , furniture , accessories , and LP ’ s . Even the music from the speakers is vintage !

"users you are designing for . Data can help you in many different ways . It can show you how visitors use your pages or app , where they leave your funnel or what they find challenging . Here are a few places to get data : If your company has a call center where they document customer questions , ask for these documents and analyze them . Look for tasks they cannot complete or things that aren ’ t clear to them . If the contents of calls aren ’ t documented , ask customer service if you can be their intern for a few hours or a day . Listening to calls from the people you design for is very interesting and will give you lots of insights . If your company ’ s website or app has a feedback module ( Usabilla for example ) , ask for access to the feedback that is generated . Learn how people navigate through your site . Which page has the highest lead attribution ? If you can find out which page is most important for your user , it teaches you what they need to know before purchasing your product . If you work for a company where designs are being tested with customers , ask for reports of these tests . These reports will give you so much insight and will prevent you from making mistakes other designers made in the past .

"a result of this title , he has been invited by World Records University to apply for its Honorary Doctrate Degree in Records Breaking . This university is an accumulation of various national and international record organisations . It provides this degree to people who are at least a national record holder . It will enable them to use the prefix of “ Dr . ” with their name . In a similar incident , Gurmeet Ram Rahim was eligible to apply the same prefix but the prefix did not come to use by people . The issue is that it is a case of acknowledgement which is being accommodating to the extent of providing the highest possible degree of honor in record breaking . It has a fee of around INR NUM , NUM for enrollment . If we are to take the case of MD Zabi Khan , who is a social worker and gains funds through other people , if he is someone who can spend this amount of money for the fee , it can also come from him as an investment in his own undertaking .

If it is public fund which is used for working , will the fund be directed into attaining this title in that case ?

"Isn ’ t public fund being misused in this case ? The use to which it will be put is ultimately self-branding . With social media becoming a platform where once something is put up , it is believed in , the title can also be misleading where it is only read before the name without the context of it . Because the prefix of “ Dr . ” comes after years of extensive hard work in the field of education and denotes a person ’ s knowledge , such degrees have also been termed as “ fake ” doctorate degrees . If the reason behind achieving the record is the effort put by him in his venture , the facilitation of it is the main purpose of it all . Had the university been monetary reward oriented , it would have been more beneficial to such activists . But the whole idea of this degree seems hollow to an extent because it isn ’ t serving any other purpose than the publicity of the person in question and thus , becomes misleading in its very name . MD Zabi Khan was not working for being the youngest animal activist , he started social work to help . Does it then serve him in any way as an activist to choose to direct public money for the doctorate ? Yes but for selfish interests . The university is largely for record holders and wants a thesis of their journey to judge them .

Timing safe comparisonWhile a timing attack for CSRF tokens is probably more theoretical , it would be possible for attackers to guess the token by repeating the same request many times , and comparing the time it takes to return .

( Wexman NUM ) Makavejev ’ s works are like a statement about sex and politics . In general , before the NUMs the majority of movies were playing the role of entertainment or they were educational . After World War II , cinema was also used as a tool to portray political beliefs . Long before the invention of motion picture , art and specifically literature played a political role in Europe .

Ideally the above flow should happen , but it didn ’ t , and the user went to / order page without accepting the agreement after login . The agreement page never showed up . However when using an incognito tabNUMwe saw this agreement page coming . Since incognito tab in chrome uses fresh cache store , it was clear that the issue was related to caching . The culprit that was helping in caching this was the status code we were using for / order . It was a NUM redirect . NUM status code tells the client that the url has been permanently moved to a new location . So when the users were logging into the web application the response got cached to / order . Sending an new HTML response or a new url redirection was giving us NUM Moved Permanently ( from browser cache ) and the user was going to / order page .

Why is it important for Iranians across the world and why do they do their best , literally going through water and fire , to make sure they have the most beautiful Haft-Seen and the most jolly New Year celebration each year ? A : To my mind , Nowruz releases a continuous spirituality that is imbued with human compassion , cultural dialogue and a form of cosmopolitan empathy that is very typical for Iran . The aesthetics of the haft-seen act as a metaphorical frame to this celebration of life . Today , Nowruz continues to symbolise a “ Geist ” in an increasingly spiritless world . Q : You have taught students of different nationalities at SOAS . Have you been asked questions about Nowruz ? What are those questions ? And how have you tried to respond ? A : Indeed , I have encountered students and academic colleagues from all over the world . SOAS is a unique institution in this regard . In the Department of Politics and International Studies , where I am based , I have been repeatedly asked about Persian culture , including the meaning of Nowruz and its role in contemporary life in Iran . The questions tend to relate to the cultural significance of the celebrations .

My career and professional expectations have changed slightly since taking up the Ph . D . I remain as motivated to perform and be creative in my music but I am also held back by academic workload and intellectual preparation for my dissertation . Bear in mind , I had no exposure to most of the musicological theories that are being discussed very skilfully and competitively at King ’ s and therefore , the music feels like it has taken a back seat over the imminent importance of having a solid theoretical background for music research .

Based on their centre ’ s observations , most stalkers are former partners of their victims , who see stalking as a way to save their broken relationship . ‘ Stalking is a typical ‘ old behaviour , new crime ’ situation — it has always been there . Look at our culture — the first story about a stalker we see is Apollo chasing the nymph Daphne , who had to turn into a tree . Because this law is so new , it hasnt yet taken root in our culture , and victims may not realise that they are entitled to help . Laws are different across the world , and Russia , for example , doesnt even recognise it as an offence — unlike Germany , where it is criminalised .

But later on , in the days of modernism , the motto changed to “ we know what it ’ s good for yourself ” , and this was where the role of the designer started to become a part of the cultural education , simply by trying to educate the customer on what was good for him . Unfortunately , both these models were wrong , since they represented the designer either as a complete passive subject or as some kind of pedagogically abusive individual in relation to the customer and the culture . For the designer to counter that trend , it was necessary that the product of its work could be something instructive . An action , a strategy or an object were enough to guarantee the perpetuating , evolving and transforming of the society throughout its express intention or not , over the several elements of that same society .

The spread in the polls today is not big enough to consider the election clinched for Hillary and it ’ s actually shrinking again lately . The reason for this is that Donald Trump has a core base of supporters that are as solid as one of those bricks he wants to use to build The Wall . A video proving that The Donald killed JFK may appear and it won ’ t change a thing . His base either doesn ’ t care or thinks everything is a cover up by the establishment .

English-language internet is full of stories about condescending judges telling their victims to be proud of the attention , and not taking their complaints seriously . In Russia , on the other hand , stalking is not even considered an offence . It is not mentioned in any laws . ‘ Russian criminal law doesnt even include a notion of stalking . The only article that can , somehow , be used to protect a victim in this case , is that against death threats . In reality , though , the victims just have to cope with this on their own , ’ — says Mary Davtyan , a lawyer , who specialises on domestic violence cases . There are no organisations of any kind that would protect victims of stalking , either . Some can use shelters — stalking is often a part of domestic violence , and shelters were designed for that . Interestingly , private domestic violence help centres keep the location of their shelters secret — while those run by the state don ’ t conceal it .

We can see now and understand that Trump has a whole group of victims around him who are there to please him , work for him , carry out his orders and will stick to him till the bitter end . They are all constant terrified by him , living in an extreme tension , seeking how to please him . Even if it looks as if some are sticking to him for political reasons , or to better themselves , the basis is they are somehow caught up in this co-dependence with him and are his victims who can not appose him . Trump has a very weak self-regulation and impulse control , is easily influenced by others and by evil entities . Trump has also no ability to reflect on his impulses before acting . That is why he gets himself in constant trouble afterwards . This is the main reason why he is ‘ forced ’ into constant — pathological lying . He has a very weak self-regulation and impulse control .

"s an Irish pub , and they only insist on English . It ’ s a nice place , and not really expensive , for Geneva , at least . You know it ’ s an extremely expensive city . Most of our guests are your average middle-class people , young , or a bit older , and most of them are really nice . Of course , you get nasty ones everywhere . People come here for brinks , but I have only once seen a really drunk one — and it ’ s been several months . Luckily , the manager took care of that . Most of the people who work in this bar do it as their main job , not like me . There are about NUM people working here in total , but we work in shifts , and I never get to work with the same people , because my timetable always changes . One week I work NUM nights , and another it will be one . Every shift lasts NUM to NUM hours . I earn enough to pay for my rent and food — and I ’ m happy with my salary , which is higher than in the Eurozone — about NUM € per hour . I ’ ve had several part-time jobs : babysitting , teaching Italian … but I like this one most . But I must say , most of unpaid interns in Geneva ( and there are a lot ! ) don ’ t have part-time jobs like me , and have either really small ones , like teaching , or rely on their parents .

"not ) have the inborn ability to think relationally and become better and better at solving problems . Geometry , music , language , relatedness , connection , variation , structure , freedom and all the base parameters for creating are all here ! And when combined with TIME ! Well , let ’ s start doing some grand thinking in action and solve big and small problems . There is no need to wait for any type of special ‘ feeling ’ . Maybe you don ’ t see it my way , maybe for you ‘ feeling creative ’ is the essence of what you want , that ’ s ok too . But , there is a danger in waiting for the right moment as it takes the attention away from what is : The ability to think , perceive , and be within our living experience in a relational manner . Relating our current position in relationship to the path we have chosen , its direction , its arteries , ebbs , flows , stagnations , and its relation to the whole of the community we call mankind , the universal rights of being a human , and the environment we are here to protect and preserve . Wow ! Imagine if we could demand governments and industries to be kept accountable on a ‘ relational ’ manner ! The question to ask is maybe we can ? It ’ s a big stretch to come from creative pursuits , through mothernhood to arrive at taking responsibility for a collective social wellbeing … . But this kind of relationally generated reasoning out process could give birth to unlimited creative energy and drive ; as well as holding the tools for controlling its direction and flow .",female,iran,test
